<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a project exploring the dimensionality (covariation of multiple dimensions of biodiversity) across passerines within North American bird conservation regions.

This project is currently under construction!

### Built With

* [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jessealaney/North_America_Passerine_Diversity_Dimensionality.git
```
2. Install R packages
```sh
install.packages("pacman") 
pacman::p_load(ape, phytools, plyr, picante, treescape, janitor, vegan, pez, FD, classInt, tibble,phyloregion, data.table, tools, tidyr, dplyr)
```
3. Run the master script
```sh
scripts/NA_passerines_dimensionality.R
```
